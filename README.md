The published documentation:

Wisdom
------

Articles, policies, advice and so on - all the kinds of thing that people are full of and willing to share.

Recipes
-------

Recipes are carefully-written guides. They probably won't provide any
information that isn't already out there, but will put it in a consistent
form, while its content will be oriented towards the Python/Django user.

Feel free to contribute anything! The *Python/Django DevOp's Book of Wisdom
and Recipes* is going to be much use if there are only apprentices and no
sorcerers adding material to it.
